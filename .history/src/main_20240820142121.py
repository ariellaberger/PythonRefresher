    This module is the main entry point for the PythonRefresher project.
    It initializes the program, handles command-line arguments, and runs the primary functions.

        """if __name__ == "__main__":: 
        This line checks if the script is being run directly 
        (the Python script is executed as the main program, rather than being imported as 
        a module in another script.)
        
        If it is being run directly, it calls the main() function
Why __name__ is Useful
Distinguishing Between Script and Module Usage: The __name__ variable allows a script to know 
whether itâ€™s being executed on its own or being used as part of another program.
Testing and Reusability: You can include code for testing or running the script directly 
within the if __name__ == "__main__": block, while keeping the rest of your functions and classes reusable in other scripts
